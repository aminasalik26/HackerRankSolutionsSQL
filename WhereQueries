# QUESTION 1) Query a list of `CITY` names from `STATION` for cities that have an even `ID` number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

The `STATION` table is described as follows:

| Field  | Type           | Description                        |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| ID     | NUMBER         | Unique identifier for the station  |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21)   | Name of the city                   |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)    | State where the city is located    |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER         | Latitude coordinate of the station |
| LONG_W | NUMBER         | Longitude coordinate of the station|


## SQL SOLUTION

SELECT DISTINCT
    CITY
FROM 
    STATION
WHERE
    ID % 2 = 0;




# QUESTION 2) Find the difference between the total number of `CITY` entries in the table and the number of distinct `CITY` entries in the table.

The `STATION` table is described as follows:

| Field  | Type           | Description                        |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| ID     | NUMBER         | Unique identifier for the station  |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21)   | Name of the city                   |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)    | State where the city is located    |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER         | Latitude coordinate of the station |
| LONG_W | NUMBER         | Longitude coordinate of the station|


## SQL SOLUTION

SELECT 
    COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) 
    AS DIFFERENCES
FROM 
    STATION;




# QUESTION 3) Query the two cities in `STATION` with the shortest and longest `CITY` names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

The `STATION` table is described as follows:

| Field  | Type           | Description                        |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| ID     | NUMBER         | Unique identifier for the station  |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21)   | Name of the city                   |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)    | State where the city is located    |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER         | Latitude coordinate of the station |
| LONG_W | NUMBER         | Longitude coordinate of the station|


## SQL SOLUTION

### Shortest City Name
SELECT
    CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAMELENGTH
FROM
    STATION
ORDER BY
    LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY
LIMIT
    1;

### Longest City Name
SELECT
    CITY, LENGTH(CITY) AS NAMELENGTH
FROM
    STATION
ORDER BY
    LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
LIMIT
    1;




# QUESTION 4) Query the list of `CITY` names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from `STATION`. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

The `STATION` table is described as follows:

| Field  | Type           | Description                        |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| ID     | NUMBER         | Unique identifier for the station  |
| CITY   | VARCHAR2(21)   | Name of the city                   |
| STATE  | VARCHAR2(2)    | State where the city is located    |
| LAT_N  | NUMBER         | Latitude coordinate of the station |
| LONG_W | NUMBER         | Longitude coordinate of the station|


## SQL SOLUTION

SELECT DISTINCT(CITY)
FROM
    STATION
WHERE
    CITY LIKE 'A%'
    OR CITY LIKE 'E%'
    OR CITY LIKE 'I%'
    OR CITY LIKE 'O%'
    OR CITY LIKE 'U%';
